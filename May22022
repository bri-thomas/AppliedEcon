PRACTICE FOR THE MIDTERM

(6) What should the regression look like?
   - What kinds of functional form checks should we do to see if we want polynomials or logs?
   - How should we construct the regression?

  We might want to regress I(personSearch == 'YES' | vehicleSearch == 'YES') on I(race == 'black'), neighborhood, and problem
  - Let's first look at a basic comparison of means just to see what we're looking at.
  - Keep in mind that the result will still be biased! We haven't really controlled for WhatDoing, and we've shut off the Black → Stopped → Searched 
  pathway (plus, should we have gone back and put Gender in there and figured out whether to control for that too?)
  - These are all binary variables, we can't really do logs or polynomials of them
  - Unfortunately, going through the work of laying out what regression we should run doesn't always give us a regression that's feasible! Often what 
  we can run has problems still
  - We can run another analysis with an interaction between Black and Problem

MplsStops <- MplsStops %>%
  mutate(Stopped = personSearch == 'YES' | vehicleSearch == 'YES',
         Black = race == 'Black')
m1 <- feols(Stopped ~ Black, data = MplsStops)
m2 <- feols(Stopped ~ Black + problem + neighborhood, data = MplsStops)
m3 <- feols(Stopped ~ Black*problem + neighborhood, data = MplsStops)

(7) What is the result? (what tests should we look at?)
  - Before we look at the result, what results might we see and how would we interpret them?
    - What checks would we want to do?
    - What tests should we run?
    - How should we think about whether we want to use robust standard errors?

The Result: Interpret these coefficients (keep in mind Neighborhood is not shown)!
  - Do we think that the coefficient on Black is likely to be biased up or down?

Other Tests
  We see that officers choose to search stopped Black people much more often than stopped non-Black people, controlling for neighborhood and 
 the type of problem - 13% more!
  It also seems like the effect is much stronger for stops the police reported as "suspicious" (20%) rather than "traffic" stops (20-13 = 7%). 
 The difference (13%) is statistically significant at the .1% level
  Is the effect of Black still significant for Traffic stops? What test would we run? (Answer: the F-Test)

Yep, still significant at the .1% level! A 7% gap is pretty big, too.
